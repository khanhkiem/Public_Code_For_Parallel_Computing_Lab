# Introduction
Hi, this is August 24th, 2017. I am attending "Parallel Computing" course at [Bach Khoa University](http://bku.edu.vn/) for undergraduated student.  
I create this project to share my code to everyone, especially my classmate. So they can use as solution, reference, etc.. .Or they can give feedback, discussion before deadline.  
About our lab, Our instructor have coded nearly everything, our work is to implement small thing in it.  
# Availability
- **Example** code is available **as soon as posible**.
- **Exercise** code is available **after deadline**.
- When our course is over, I won't receive feedback and update my code anymore.
